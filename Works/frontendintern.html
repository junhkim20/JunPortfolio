			<h2 class="logoh2"> I worked with a nonprofit organization, Connecticut Afterschool Network, as a Frontend Developer Intern. My role was to update and improve their outdated website. <br><br> The left image is the homepage of the redesigned website that I built. During this internship, I was able to make the website more secure by improving their domain services and revamp their current website with the use of WordPress Plugins, HTML, and CSS.</h2>

			<h2 class="fronth2top"> I created a wireframe of the website to get feedback from the team. During this process, I designed different elements for the website and organized various contents since the website was filled with information. <br><br> The right image is an example of some elements designed by me and how contents were organized throughout the website.</h2>
