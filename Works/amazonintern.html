			<h1 class="logoh1"> Amazon SDE Internship </h1>
			<h2 class="logoh2"> I was a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon Inc., specifically in Amazon Robotics Robin Perception team. <br><br> Robin is this robot arm responsible  for recognizing where each package should go and assigning them to the correct delivery bin. As an intern, my project was related to creating a tool that will allow the analyzation of all of Robin's data from its failure to its successes.</h2>

			<h2 class="vidh2"> I first had a design process overview with the team engineers to get their feedbacks. Then, AWS tools, S3, EMR, and SageMaker, were used to complete my internship. <br><br> I was able to speed up the process of the data analyzation by 10 times from the previous tool that the team already had. The details and a demo of my completed project was presented to the team at the end of the internship.</h2>
